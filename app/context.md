# oliva-app/app Context

## Purpose

Expo Router scaffold directory generated by template setup.

## Main Files and Entry Points

- `_layout.tsx`, `modal.tsx`, and `(tabs)/` route scaffold files.

## Architecture and Patterns

- File-based routing structure from Expo template.

## Domain Concepts and Business Rules

- Current mobile runtime entry is `../App.tsx` (WebView wrapper); this folder is secondary scaffold.

## Interactions and Dependencies

- Uses Expo Router primitives where enabled.

## Conventions for New Code

### Do
- Align with product direction before moving logic from wrapper entry into Expo Router screens.

### Don’t
- Don’t split production flows between `App.tsx` and router screens without a clear migration plan.
